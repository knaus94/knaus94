### About Me

I am a skilled Backend Engineer with over 5 years of experience, adept at merging backend development with modern DevOps practices to deliver comprehensive, end-to-end solutions.

I specialize in creating scalable systems using NestJS and have extensive experience with programming languages such as PHP, Bash, Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, Golang, and Python.

Beyond backend development, I possess a strong foundation in DevOps, including expertise in Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure automation. I am proficient in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines, implementing containerized environments, configuring cloud-native solutions, and maintaining highly available, secure, and optimized production systems. My skill set extends to infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools such as Terraform and monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana, ensuring operational excellence at every stage of the deployment lifecycle.
