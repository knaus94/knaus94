### About Me

I am an accomplished Backend Engineer with over 5 years of experience, combining expertise in software development and DevOps practices.

I specialize in building robust solutions with NestJS and have a strong command of languages such as PHP, Bash, Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript, Golang, and Python.

In addition to backend development, I excel in DevOps, with proficiency in Docker, Kubernetes, and managing the entire deployment lifecycle, including designing and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and ensuring seamless production deployments.

My approach emphasizes innovation, a deep understanding of modern technologies, and a commitment to delivering efficient, scalable solutions. I am continually enhancing my expertise and adopting new tools to stay ahead in a fast-evolving industry.
