### About Me

I am a Backend Engineer with 3 + years of hands‑on experience building robust, scalable services. My primary focus is NestJS, complemented by solid proficiency in PHP, Bash, Node.js, TypeScript, Go, and Python.

### Technical Focus

● Scalable Architecture: Design and implement high‑performance systems that handle rapid growth and complex business logic.

● DevOps & Cloud‑Native: Deep experience with Docker and Kubernetes, crafting containerized environments and cloud‑native workloads.

● CI/CD & Automation: Build and maintain secure, highly available CI/CD pipelines that streamline delivery and reduce time‑to‑production.

● Infrastructure as Code: Provision and manage infrastructure with Terraform, ensuring repeatability and compliance.

● Observability & Reliability: Implement comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana, enabling proactive performance tuning and incident response.

### Working Style
I drive projects end‑to‑end—from architecture and coding through deployment and continuous optimization—while fostering clean code, test automation, and sustainable engineering practices.
